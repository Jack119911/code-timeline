# code-timeline
This is a plugin for [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It visualizes method calls in java using the metaphor of a timelime. It was developed as part of my bachelor thesis:

*Unterstützung des Quellcodeverständnisses bei Programmiernovizen durch kontextnahe Visualisierung von Methodenaufrufen*

or

*Supporting souce code comprehension of novice programmers with a context close visualization of method calls*

You can find this plugin in the [JetBrains Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13077-code-timeline).
There might be some bugs, just create an issue. I might solve it, or not. Or just fix it by yourself ;)
There is also a lot of space for improvement. I might work on them, or not. Feel free to contribute.
To get an impression of the structure of the source code you can view the file *class diagram.svg* in the root folder.
